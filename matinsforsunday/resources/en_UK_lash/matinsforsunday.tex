This translation of the office of Matins for Sundays and Feasts contains the complete text of the common of the office, with the exception of the Kathismata of the Psalter and the verses of the Biblical Canticles, since these are rarely used except in monasteries. In an Appendix we give the text of the first two psalms of the Polyeleos, but not the selection of verses for the various major feasts, together with Psalms 44 and 136, which may also form part of the Polyeleos on certain days. The interpolations of Psalm 44 are taken from the invaluable Sylleitourgikon, or ‘Reader’s Handbook’, published by the Holy Monastery of Simonos Petra in 1996. The full text of the short litanies that follow the readings from the Psalter and the 3rd and 6th Odes of the Canon are omitted, since these are seldom used in parishes. We do however, for completeness, give the text of the final Ekphonesis of each. The eleven Resurrection Exapostilaria and the corresponding Eothina have also been included. For the convenience of singers and readers they are given in separate sections.

The underlying Typikon is that of the Holy Mountain, to which the Russian Typikon corresponds for the most part very closely. In Greek parishes on Sundays the reading of the Gospel is normally displaced to the end of the Katavasia of the 8th Ode, immediately before the Magnificat. In this case the order for the Gospel begins with the deacon’s ‘Let us pray to the Lord’, on page 23. The Cypriot Typikon, however, preserves the traditional order. Interestingly in the old ‘Cathedral Office’, as described by St Symeon of Thessaloniki, the Gospel was sung as the climax of Sunday Matins, after the Eothinon. St Symeon regrets the increasing popularity of the monastic practice, but it eventually prevailed. In Greek parish use Matins normally precedes the Liturgy, which begins immediately after the Troparion ‘Today salvation has come to the world’, used for all eight Tones, the concluding litanies and dismissal being said quietly in the sanctuary by the priest and deacon.
%</"p0004">
%<*"p0005">
The rubric that the priest should come out to read the Matins prayers during the Six Psalms at the beginning of the 5th Psalm rather than the 4th is, in fact, what the Typikon of St Savvas directs, and it is still the practice of some monasteries. In the old order, presupposed by the Typikon of St Savvas, the Six Psalms were chanted solemnly and there was therefore time to read all Twelve Prayers during the last two Psalms. The Six Psalms should be read by one reader, not divided between several. They are one of the gerontika, that is the parts normally read by the Superior, and should be allocated to a senior person, such a visiting priest. All should remain standing during the Six Psalms. They are not an opportunity, for Singers in particular, to practice that well-known Orthodox rubric, ‘Here beginneth the animated discussion’.
%</"p0005">
%<*"p0006">
When Matins forms part of a Vigil it follows the Artoklasia at the end of Vespers. The Midnight Office is omitted, though some monasteries read the Canon to the Trinity at a Vigil on a Sunday. In normal monastic use the blessing by the priest that concludes the Artoklasia is followed by a patristic reading. After the reader has announced the title, the priest gives the usual blessing, ‘Blessed is our God…’, and the reader begins. At the end of the reading the Six Psalms begin at once, with ‘Glory to God in the highest…’. The Royal Office is omitted entirely. If there is no reading, the Six Psalms follow the blessing by the priest, ‘The blessing of the Lord be upon you…,’ which ends the Artoklasia. The First Hour is read at the end of Matins, unless the Liturgy follows at once, and we have therefore included it here.
%</"p0006">
%<*"p0007">
In most parishes the Royal Office is abbreviated, and, the censing and the two Psalms being omitted, the Reader begins at once with the Trisagion.
%</"p0007">
%<*"p0008">
When Matins is celebrated in full it is not normal for the deacon to vest until the Anavathmi, the priest saying all the preceding litanies himself. In Greek parish use, the clergy vest and perform the Proskomidi during the first part of Matins, after the Litany of Peace. In monasteries the celebrating clergy take the kairos during the reading of the Psalter and then return to their stalls until it is time for them to vest for the Liturgy. In parishes the kairos is taken after the Six Psalms and Litany of Peace, or even before the beginning of the service.
%</"p0008">
%<*"p0009">
The prayer after Psalm 50 is the text, apart from the addition of Mothers among the ascetics, as it appears in the earliest sources. It is now customary to expand it with a great many additional names in accordance with local custom.

%<*"p0010">
Most of the technical terms, including those printed in italic in this preface, are explained in a short Glossary at the end.
%</"p0010">
%<*"p0011">
Since Matins is a longer and more complex service than Vespers and the ways of celebrating it vary more widely, it is not feasible to provide for every possible use.

After the Dismissal of the Midnight Office the Priest, having made the customary metania to the Superior, or to his stall, enters the sanctuary and makes three bows before the holy Table. He puts on the Epitrachelion and, standing in front of the Holy Table, intones:

May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and support you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour your whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart’s desire, and fulfil your every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be magnified in the name of our the Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation of his right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will call on the name of the Lord our God. They were fettered and fell, but we have risen and been set upright. Lord, save the king, and hear us on the day we call upon you.

The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will exult exceedingly in your salvation. You gave him his heart’s desire; you did not deny him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings of goodness; you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head. He asked you for life, and you gave him length of days for age on age. Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age, and make him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king puts his hope in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all your enemies, and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them like a blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will confound them in his wrath and fire will devour them. You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed from among the children of humankind. Because they intended evils against you, and devised plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will put them to flight; among your remnants you will prepare their presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing and praise your mighty acts.

The priest must take care that he is standing beneath the Polyeleos to say this conclusion. He then enters the sanctuary, puts away the censer and takes his stand in front of the Holy Table.

Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise against me. Many say to my soul, ‘There is no salvation for him in his God’. But you, Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With my voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my God; because you have struck all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord's, and your blessing is upon your people.

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand upon me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning all day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life used force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in whose mouth there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will answer me, O Lord my God. For I said: Let my foes never exult over me. When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin. But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly have been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation.

O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has thirsted for you, my flesh how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I appeared before you in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is better than life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness; my mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every dawn I meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your wings I shall rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me. But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth, they will be delivered to the power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes. But the king will rejoice in God, and all who swear by him will be praised; for the mouths of those who speak iniquities have been stopped.

Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you. Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication. For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against me. You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you, Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for the dead; or will physicians raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your mercy in the tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be known in the dark, or your justice in a land that has been forgotten? But to you, Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why have you rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in toils since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have put far from me, and my companions because of my misery.

Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He forgives all your iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your life from corruption and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire with good things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle's. The Lord performs deeds of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his ways to Moses, his wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful, nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height of heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from us. As a father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who fear him. For he knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust. As for man, his days are but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will be no more and will know its place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon those who fear him; and his justice upon their children's children, upon those who keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the Lord, all you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and listen to the voice of his words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his works. In every place of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!

Lord, hear my prayer; in your truth give ear to my supplication, and in your justice hear me. Do not enter into judgement with your servant, for in your sight no one living can be justified. For the enemy pursued my soul; humbled my life to the ground; made me dwell in darkness, like those for ever dead. My spirit in me grew weary, and my heart was troubled within me. I remembered days of old; I meditated on all your works. I made the works of your hands my meditation. I stretched out my hands towards you; my soul thirsted for you like a waterless land. Hear me swiftly, O Lord; my spirit has failed. Do not turn your face from me, or I shall be like those who go down to the Pit. Make me hear of your mercy in the morning, for I have hoped in you. Make known to me the way in which I should walk, for to you I have lifted up my soul. Deliver me from my enemies, Lord; I have run to you for shelter. Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your good Spirit will guide me in an upright land. For your name's sake, O Lord, you will give me life. In your justice you will bring my soul out of trouble; in your mercy slay my enemies, and destroy all those who afflict my soul, for I am your servant.

Treasury of blessings, ever-flowing Source, Holy Father, worker of wonders, all-powerful and almighty, we all worship you and beseech you, as we invoke your acts of mercy and compassion to help and assist our lowliness. Remember your suppliants, Lord; accept the morning prayers of us all like incense before you, and make none of us reprobate, but keep us all through your acts of compassion. Remember, Lord, those who keep vigil and who chant to your glory and that of your Son and our God and of your Holy Spirit. Be their help and their aid; accept their supplications on your heavenly and spiritual altar.

Therefore we beg you, Lord: Give us grace and power, so that we may be counted worthy to chant to you with understanding and to pray without ceasing in fear and trembling, as we work out our salvation through the assistance of your Son.

In most Greek parishes the Gospel is then taken to back of the church, preceded by the candle, and placed on a stand near the west end of the church, so that latecomers may venerate it. There follows the veneration of the Gospel, after which the Priest returns to the Sanctuary and places the Gospel on the Holy Table, or, where it is the custom, at the back of the Church.

You have hated all those who work iniquity; you will destroy all those who speak lies. The Lord abhors a man of bloodshed and deceit. But I, in the abundance of your mercy, will enter your house, I will worship towards your holy temple in fear of you. Guide me, Lord, in your justice because of my enemies, direct my way before you. Because there is no truth in their mouths; their heart is vain. Their throat is an open tomb, they deceive with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let them fall through their counsels; according to the multitude of their impieties cast them out, for they have embittered you, O Lord. And may all those who hope in you be glad; they will rejoice for ever, and you will dwell among them, and all those who love your name will boast in you. Because you will bless the righteous; you have crowned him, O Lord, with your good pleasure.

%<*"p0452">
Lord, you have been our refuge from one generation to another. Before the mountains came into being or the earth and the world were formed, from age to age you are. Do not turn humankind back to humiliation, and you said: Turn back, children of men. Because a thousand years in your eyes, Lord, are like a day, or like yesterday which has passed, and like a watch in the night. Their years will be mere trifles, in the morning like grass may he pass away. In the morning let him flower and pass away; in the evening let him fall, dry up and wither. Because we have perished in your anger, and in your wrath we have been dismayed. You have set our iniquities before you; our age in the light of your countenance. Because all our days have perished, and in your anger we have perished; our years were reckoned like a spider. The days of our years there are seventy years in them, but if we are strong, eighty, and the majority of them are labour and toil; because weakness has come over us and we shall be chastened. Who knows the might of your anger? And can gauge your wrath from fear of you? So make your right hand known to me, and those chastened in heart by wisdom. Turn back, O Lord, how long? And be entreated for your servants. We have been filled in the morning with your mercy, O Lord, and we have rejoiced and been glad. In all our days let us be glad; in return for the days when you humbled us, the years when we saw evils. And look upon your servants and upon the work of your hands and guide your children. And let the brightness of the Lord be upon us, and direct the works of our hands for us, and direct the work of our hand.

I will sing to you of mercy and judgement, O Lord, I will chant and think on a blameless way. When will you come to me? I have walked in the midst of my house in the innocence of my heart. I have set no lawless deed before my eyes; I have hated those who commit transgressions. No twisted heart has been attached to me; the evil man who avoids me I have not acknowledged. The man who secretly slanders his neighbour, him I have driven out. With a man of proud looks and insatiate heart I have not eaten. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, for them to dwell with me; the man who walks on a blameless way, he has ministered to me. The man who acts proudly has not dwelt in my house; the man who speaks calumnies has not prospered before me. Morning by morning I slew all the sinners in the land, to purge from the Lord's city all workers of iniquity.

At their intercessions, O Christ, guard your flock from wolves that ravage it.

The following Psalm of the Polyeleos is sung on the two Sundays before Lent, Meat Sunday and Cheese Sunday. When this Psalm is sung Psalm 118 is not sung, but in its place Psalm 134. Psalm 136 takes the place of the Selection. We also light the Polyeleos. Note that in the Russian use Psalm 136 is also used on the two preceding Sundays, those of the Prodigal Son and of the Last Judgement.
